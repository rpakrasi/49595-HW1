Each layer learns increasingly abstract features, from simple patterns to complex concepts. It has achieved breakthrough results in image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition."}]}

Common methods include L1 regularization (Lasso), which encourages sparsity, and L2 regularization (Ridge), which penalizes large weights. Dropout is another popular regularization technique for neural networks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant that provides clear and concise answers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is an embedding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An embedding is a learned representation that maps discrete items (like words or categories) into continuous vector spaces. These dense, low-dimensional vectors capture semantic relationships, where similar items have similar vector representations. Word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe are common examples used in NLP to represent words numerically."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant that provides clear and concise answers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How does backpropagation work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks by computing gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight. It works backward through the network using the chain rule of calculus, calculating how much each weight contributed to the error. These gradients are then used by optimization algorithms like gradient descent to update the weights."}]}
