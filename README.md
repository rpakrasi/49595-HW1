## Evaluation Results from Latest Run 

YOU: How are you?

TRUMP: Thank you. I think I've done a great job, but we're not happy with it because of the people that are killing us every night on our streets, and they are killing us through drugs and human trafficking and all of these different things. And they are killing us through other countries, like China. They're killing us through other countries, where they send their supply chains to make us less competitive and less powerful as a country. But I think I've done an amazing job. You know when you come into the Presidency, there was no such thing as an opioid crisis; now it's a full-blown epidemic. We were down 30 years in a row of losing manufacturing jobs – they're all back up; we have more than ever before.

YOU: - How is the economy doing?

TRUMP: It's doing great. If you look at all the economic indicators, they're the best we've ever had – lowest unemployment number for African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans; highest stock market numbers in history. And that was a bad time to go into war with China, but we had to do it because they ripped off our country – rip off millions of jobs, trillions of dollars' worth of goods and services – no more. We're going to have the strongest military by far. I will tell you this: Sleepy Joe – he's trying like a crazy person to find someplace that we didn't do well – he can't do it because it's never happened before, including when he was Vice President, where everything went right and he did nothing; there's nothing for him to talk about.

YOU: What do you think about the current political situation?

TRUMP: I think it's terrible. And I think we're going to make it better than ever before. We're going to have the best, strongest, biggest country that we've ever had in our history. We can do it; we can do it quickly and easily if we just focus on what we all know is right. Now he wants open borders – no more DACA, no more TPS – every other country has this, but they don't have us – nobody else has the same thing with them. And he doesn't even want to take care of our own citizens. The last two weeks I've taken care of a lot of seniors and veterans that are having trouble getting their checks. They're out of money; we got it approved for them.

YOU: What he's saying, it's ridiculous. The economy is showing signs of recovery, but we still have a long way to go. We are focused on creating jobs, supporting small businesses, and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all Americans.

TRUMP: You said it yourself, you're lucky – and you know it, because if you had a real competition, I don't think you would be here. You'd be somewhere in Manhattan or someplace else talking about whatever he's got there with his son. If you look at his family, they make money off of China. They make money from Russia. We're going to have the strongest tax, regulatory, and environmental laws anywhere in the world. And we'll protect our environment, but we can't do it if we don't have – we have to have an economy that is strong and healthy; otherwise you don't have a country. The worst thing he could do for this country would be to win this election because what he will do is destroy this country totally and you know it.

YOU: You are wrong. My administration is committed to addressing the climate crisis and transitioning to a clean energy economy.

TRUMP: He's got the worst record in history. He was Vice President for 8 years; he did nothing, and now he talks about it like I should say 'thank you very much' because he is talking about it right now. All of these different things – he has no plan for anybody; all he does is talk to you. And he's been there a long time. You know what? We're going to take care of our environment, but we can't do that if we don't have an economy that runs and works. Look at your energy costs. Your energy prices used to be – I was just looking the other day, they were coming down very rapidly; now they're up because he's doing a bad job as President, because if you look at Russia, Russia – they're flooding the market with oil right now.

YOU: Let us move on to the next question. President Trump, can you tell me about the latest advancements in technology? 

TRUMP: We had the best year ever in 2019. And then we put a pause on it – but as you know, China ripped off our country to the tune of tens of trillions of dollars and millions of jobs – I stopped them; they're not doing that anymore. They're paying us billions of dollars for tariffs now because they can't sell any product into our country if they don't pay us a tariff on it, which is okay with me. He's going to allow them to rip off our country again and he's going to do the same thing with Russia; he's going to do the same thing with Mexico. And we're going to have – because of his stupidity, I guess – we are going to have open borders once again like we had before me, and everybody was coming in through the back door because they couldn't come through the front door anymore.

YOU: Who are you?

TRUMP: You know who I am? You're the one that said 'nobody should have a gun'. But yet you got Secret Service, and they can – look at Obama, he was the worst. They used to run through his house with their guns; nobody knew where he was half of the time because they were so disorganized. Nobody knew where Joe Biden was either during this period of time because he doesn't know what he's doing, but we're going to take care of our environment and we're going to protect you from Russia and China and everybody else that wants to rip us off like they did for decades and decades under these two guys. But I can tell you – they're the worst things that ever happened to this country in terms of what's coming in, what's happening with oil, everything else; we've never had anybody worse than Obama Biden.
